# I will be writing a CS2 Internal
## Rules for this project
- No using any sort of schemas / cs2 data structures everything has to be used like an external (this is to prevent detection later on)
- Must be auto updating WITHOUT using signatures
- Must be undetected
- Must have a sort of GUI created with a dx11 hook
- Must look nice. cant just be a sloppy project put together by god knows what.
- Must have a skibidi toilet refrence at least once in the code
- Must not increase games CPU usage by a ton
- Must be organized simply and anyone who knows how to code should be able to understand it
## Current version V1.0
- this has no actual features and is just for testing the sdk theres an undetected injector if you want to use it though <3
